# Heart-Disease-Analysis-by Using BI
## Introduction
 * Business Intelligence in healthcare industry is paving the way for remote healthcare and 
 * It offer benefits of improved patient safety and management to reduced costs, and increased revenue to better visibility into financial operations.
 * BI is no longer an option for healthcare. It’s a necessity.
 
## DataSet Details
 * [DataSet Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
  ### DataSet Description 
  1) Age: displays the age of the individual.
  2) Sex: displays the gender of the individual using the following format :
    * 1 = male
    * 0 = female
 3) Chest-pain type: displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format :
    * 1 = typical angina
    * 2 = atypical angina
    * 3 = non — anginal pain
    * 4 = asymptotic
4) Resting Blood Pressure: displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)
5) Serum Cholestrol: displays the serum cholesterol in mg/dl (unit)
6)Fasting Blood Sugar: compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl.
   * If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1 (true)
   * else : 0 (false)
7) Resting ECG : displays resting electrocardiographic results
   * 0 = normal
   * 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality
   * 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
8) Max heart rate achieved : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.
   ##### Exercise induced angina :
   * 1 = yes
   * 0 = no
9) ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest: displays the value which is an integer or float.
   ##### Peak exercise ST segment :
   * 1 = upsloping
   * 2 = flat
   * 3 = downsloping
10) Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.
   ##### Thal : displays the thalassemia :
   * 3 = normal
   * 6 = fixed defect
   * 7 = reversible defect
11) Diagnosis of heart disease : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not :
   * 0 = absence
   * 1, 2, 3, 4 = present.
### Business Intelligence Tool Used:
    * Tableau
